    Generates a random topology by populating current node.

    :argument size: int, number of leaves to add under current node

    :argument None names_library: If provided, names library (list, set, dict, etc.)
        will be used to name nodes.

    :argument False reuse_names: If True, node names will not be necessarily unique,
        which makes the process a bit more efficient.

    :argument None seed: If provided, seed for random number generator

    :argument "fast" distribution: Determines the algorithm used to place leaves, which
        controls the resulting distribution over possible topologies. Parameter can be
        "fast" (original implementation), "yule", or "pda" aka "uniform".
        "fast": newly added leaves are stored in a deque (two-sided linked list), in
            each step a leaf is chosen from one end randomly, and the chosen leaf grows
            two new children.
        "yule": newly added leaves are stored in a list; in each step a leaf is chosen
            randomly from anywhere in the list, and the chosen leaf grows two new
            children. The leaf names are shuffled before assigning names to leaves.
        "uniform" or "pda": newly added leaves and interior nodes are stored in a list;
            in each step a node (interior or tip) is chosen randomly from anywhere in
            the list, and the chosen node grows a new sister leaf. The leaf names are
            shuffled before assigning names to leaves.

    :argument True ladderize: If True, newly populated subtree is ladderized before
        returning.

    :argument False random_branches: If True, branch distances and support values will
        be randomized.

    :argument (0,1) branch_range: If random_branches is True, this range of values will
        be used to generate random distances.

    :argument (0,1) support_range: If random_branches is True, this range of values will
        be used to generate random branch support values.
